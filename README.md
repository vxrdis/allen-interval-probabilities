This repository presents a **Final Year Project** investigating probabilistic extensions of Allen's Interval Algebra (a framework that defines 13 possible relationships between time intervals). It evaluates key hypotheses about interval relations using empirical simulation, statistical testing, and interactive visualisation.

The project integrates **formal temporal logic** (a system for reasoning about time using logical rules) with **stochastic modelling** (mathematical techniques for analysing random processes), offering an extensible framework for reasoning about time under uncertainty.

## Project Overview

**Allen's Interval Algebra** classifies temporal relations between intervals into 13 mutually exclusive categories. While this framework captures qualitative structure, it makes no assumptions about the relative likelihood of each relation.

This project addresses that gap by simulating interval dynamics under various probabilistic assumptions (**birth‚Äìdeath models**, where intervals randomly begin and end according to specified probabilities). It tests the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution across relations and explores how **composition tables** behave in practice ‚Äî including **entropy**, **skew**, and hypothesis alignment.

Key aims include:

- Simulating interval systems to empirically estimate the probability of each of Allen's relations
- Testing the **Principle of Indifference** and comparing to predictions from Suliman and Fernando‚ÄìVogel
- Mapping the structure of the composition table through **probabilistic chaining**
- Building an interactive dashboard for exploring simulation results

## Theoretical Motivation and Context

**Allen's Interval Algebra** provides a deterministic framework for reasoning about temporal relations between intervals. However, this classical approach faces fundamental limitations when applied to real-world scenarios where uncertainty is inevitable.

Deterministic temporal reasoning cannot adequately address:

1. **Inherent uncertainty** in establishing precise temporal boundaries
2. **Measurement imprecision** when determining interval endpoints
3. **Incomplete knowledge** about temporal sequences
4. **Varying degrees of confidence** in temporal assertions
5. **Decision-making under uncertainty** requiring probabilistic reasoning

When modelling cognitive processes, natural language understanding, or real-time systems, these limitations become critical barriers.

> A probabilistic extension of Allen's algebra allows for reasoning that accommodates uncertainty, enables robust inference from noisy data, and better reflects how humans actually reason about temporal relations.

This project specifically addresses this gap by developing an empirical foundation for probabilistic temporal reasoning that preserves the logical structure of Allen's framework while embracing uncertainty.

## Research Objectives

This project seeks to answer the following questions:

- Determine how the probabilities of Allen's interval relations vary under different **stochastic assumptions** (e.g., birth/death rates)
- Assess whether **empirical distributions** significantly differ from a uniform distribution (Principle of Indifference)
- Investigate how varying simulation parameters impact the composition and resultant probability distributions of interval chains

## Literature Review and Related Work

**Allen's Interval Algebra**, first formalised by [James F. Allen (1983)](https://doi.org/10.1145/182.358434), provides a framework of 13 qualitative relations ‚Äî such as before, meets, overlaps, and their inverses ‚Äî to describe how time intervals relate.

Although widely adopted in fields like computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and temporal logic, the original deterministic formulation does not inherently handle uncertainty or probabilistic scenarios that occur naturally in real-world temporal data.

### Probabilistic Extensions

Recent research has explored probabilistic extensions of Allen's relations:

- [Fernando and Vogel (2019)](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Tim.Fernando/NLPinAI_2019.pdf) challenged the assumption of uniform distribution among Allen's relations
- They demonstrated analytically that certain temporal relations (particularly those without endpoint coincidences) inherently occur more frequently under random conditions
- Their **finite-order model** predicts that as timelines become denser, exact endpoint coincidences approach zero probability
- Specifically, under asymptotic conditions where both birth and death probabilities approach zero (`p ‚Üí 0`, `q ‚Üí 0`), their model predicts domination by six "long-range" relations

#### Suliman's Prediction

> Suliman proposed that seven relations (equals, before, after, starts, started_by, meets, met_by) occur with probability 1/9, and the remaining six with 1/27.

At precisely balanced birth-death probabilities (`p = 0.5` and `q = 0.5`), the empirical distribution closely matches this model (œá¬≤ p ‚âà 0.76), offering strong support for Suliman's prediction. This balanced condition (equal probability of intervals starting and ending) creates the specific stochastic environment where Suliman's 1/9 vs 1/27 distribution holds.

Outside this balanced region, Suliman's model is rejected ‚Äî suggesting its validity depends on specific temporal density regimes.

#### Fernando‚ÄìVogel Asymptotic Model

> Fernando and Vogel predicted that as `p ‚Üí 0` and `q ‚Üí 0` (extremely low probabilities of birth and death), six long-range relations (before, after, during, contains, overlaps, overlapped_by) should dominate, each converging to a probability of ~1/6.

This pattern emerges clearly in simulations at extreme low `p` and `q`, supporting their **asymptotic argument** for sparse timelines.

### Complementary Frameworks

Complementary approaches have appeared in temporal reasoning frameworks and NLP:

- [Santos and Young's (1999)](<https://doi.org/10.1016/S0888-613X(99)00009-2>) **Probabilistic Temporal Networks** combined Bayesian methods with interval-based constraints
- [Badaloni and Giacomin (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2006.04.001) _A fuzzy extension of Allen's interval algebra_. _Artificial Intelligence_, 170(10), 872‚Äì908.

### Statistical Validation

Beyond theoretical and simulation frameworks, statistical analyses have been critical for validating these probabilistic models:

- Metrics such as **entropy** quantify the uncertainty inherent in relation distributions
- **Chi-square goodness-of-fit** tests have evaluated model accuracy
- Real-world datasets confirm theoretical biases ‚Äî relations like "before" dominate naturally occurring timelines

### Practical Applications

Practical applications of probabilistic Allen algebra are increasingly significant:

- **Temporal annotation standards** like [TimeML](https://timeml.github.io/) leverage these relations
- In archaeology, tools like [ArchaeoPhases](https://archaeostat.github.io/ArchaeoPhases/) use Allen's relations probabilistically to quantify uncertainty in chronological intervals

However, despite the depth of theoretical exploration, practical tools and visualisation dashboards for probabilistic Allen relations have remained limited.

> This project addresses this gap directly through interactive visualisations, allowing intuitive exploration of relation probabilities, parameter sensitivity, entropy dynamics, and three-interval composition scenarios.

This literature review highlights important research gaps that the current project aims to address: dynamically derived relation probabilities, comprehensive probabilistic composition tables, deeper empirical validation, and integrated interactive tools.

## Hypotheses and Evaluations

This project empirically tests two central hypotheses through controlled stochastic simulations.

### 1. Probability Distribution of Interval Relations

- **Null Hypothesis:** Each of Allen's 13 interval relations is equally likely to occur (uniform distribution: 1/13).

- **Method:**

  - Thousands of simulations were run with varying **birth** (`pBorn`) and **death** (`pDie`) probabilities
  - Relation counts were aggregated and normalised to estimate empirical distributions

- **Result:** The null hypothesis is consistently refuted across all parameter sets.

  - In every case, certain relations (e.g. `before`, `meets`) dominate while others (e.g. `equal`) are rare
  - This demonstrates significant and robust deviation from the theoretical uniform baseline

- **Statistical Evidence:**
  - **Entropy** varies substantially across parameter sets
  - **Chi-squared tests** consistently return p-values < 0.05
  - These confirm strong non-uniformity with high confidence

#### Suliman's Prediction

> Suliman proposed that seven relations (equals, before, after, starts, started_by, meets, met_by) occur with probability 1/9, and the remaining six with 1/27.

At balanced probabilities (`p = 0.5`, `q = 0.5`), repeated stochastic simulations (50 runs, 5000 trials each) indicate that Suliman‚Äôs predictions hold approximately 70% of the time (mean œá¬≤ p ‚âà 0.4, range: 0.15‚Äì0.8), highlighting inherent stochastic variability. This balanced condition (equal probability of intervals starting and ending) creates the specific stochastic environment where Suliman's 1/9 vs 1/27 distribution holds.

Outside this region, Suliman's model is rejected ‚Äî suggesting its validity depends on specific temporal density regimes.

#### Fernando‚ÄìVogel Asymptotic Model

> Fernando and Vogel predicted that as `p ‚Üí 0` and `q ‚Üí 0`, six long-range relations (before, after, during, contains, overlaps, overlapped_by) should dominate, each converging to a probability of ~1/6.

This pattern emerges clearly in simulations at extreme low `p` and `q`, supporting their **asymptotic argument** for sparse timelines.

#### Entropy and Skew

- Entropy is maximised when `p` and `q` are moderate (e.g. 0.5)
- Entropy is minimised when intervals are short and rare
- The **PMS/OD ratio** (precedes, meets, starts vs. overlaps, during) grows extremely large in sparse regimes ‚Äî e.g. over 2000√ó
- This confirms strong structural skew in relation types when intervals are brief or rarely instantiated

### 2. Composition Table Probabilities

- **Null Hypothesis:** All entries in Allen's interval composition table are equally probable under random chains (e.g. xRy ‚àß yRz ‚áí x?z).

- **Method:**

  - Simulations of triple-interval chains estimate the frequency of inferred compositions
  - For each pair of input relations (r1, r2), we track the empirical distribution over resulting compositions r3
  - Results are collected in `COMP_RESULTS.md` showing the probability distribution for each composition

- **Result:** The composition table exhibits significant structural bias:

  - Certain compositions consistently result in specific relations with high probability
  - Other compositions show high entropy with diverse possible outcomes
  - The empirical distributions often deviate from theoretical predictions

- **Statistical Evidence:**
  - Normalized entropy values quantify uncertainty in composition outcomes
  - Chi-squared tests confirm non-uniformity of relation distributions
  - Composition frequencies show clear patterns (as visualized in Table B)

---

## Visualisation and Interaction

To effectively communicate findings, **interactive visualisations** and comprehensive reports are generated, allowing intuitive exploration of interval relation probabilities and compositional logic.

### Report Types

  - Includes entropy measures, Gini coefficients, and Jensen-Shannon divergence comparisons
  - Provides best-fit theoretical model comparisons (uniform, Suliman, Fernando-Vogel)
  - Presents distribution visualisations in table format with normalized frequency values
  - Includes parameter sensitivity analysis across different birth/death probability combinations

- **COMP_RESULTS.md**: Comprehensive analysis of composition probabilities
  - Shows empirical distributions for all 169 possible relation compositions
  - Includes approximate fraction representations for easier interpretation
  - Highlights high-entropy vs. deterministic compositions
  - Provides sorted tables of most common composition patterns

### Statistical Measures

The reports include several key statistical measures:

- **Entropy**: Quantifies uncertainty in relation distributions (higher values indicate more even distributions)
- **Normalised Entropy**: Entropy scaled to [0,1] range for easier comparison
- **JS Divergence**: Jensen-Shannon divergence comparing empirical distributions to theoretical models
- **Chi-Square Tests**: Statistical tests measuring goodness-of-fit to theoretical distributions
- **Gini Coefficient**: Measures distribution inequality (0 = perfect equality, 1 = maximum inequality)

For detailed results and extensive visualisations, please refer to the generated reports in `SIM_RESULTS.md` and `COMP_RESULTS.md`.
