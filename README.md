# Probabilities of Allen Interval Relations

Final Year Project — B.A. (Mod.) in Computer Science, Linguistics and a Language  
Trinity College Dublin

## Overview

This project extends Allen’s Interval Algebra (1983) by introducing probabilistic modeling and simulations to handle uncertainty in temporal relations and their composition.

## Features

- Implementation of 13 Allen interval relations
- Composition (transitivity) table logic
- Probabilistic simulations (birth/death state transitions)
- Hypothesis testing and evaluation
- Visualisation of results

## Project Structure

- `relations.py` – Allen relations and composition logic  
- `simulations.py` – Probabilistic simulation engine  
- `README.md` – Project description
